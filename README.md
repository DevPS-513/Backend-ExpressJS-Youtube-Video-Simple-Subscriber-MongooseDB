# Backend-ExpressJS-Youtube-Video-Simple-Subscriber-MongooseDB
An implementation of a basic REST API to interact with a database of subscribers. I did this after watching a similar tutorial by  Web Dev Simplified called Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick. Their repo is https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Your-First-Node-REST-API . This has extra functionality of an API key and some generalization in how
the data fields are handled.
 


### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Example Data

```json

   {
        "name": "Eric Redz",
        "email": "default-email7",
        "subscriberdate": "2024-01-22T22:16:09.941Z",
    }


    ```
### Notes

run with node server.js or npm start to auto-refresh with nodemon
